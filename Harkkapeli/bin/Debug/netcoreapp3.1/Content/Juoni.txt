Forest: You have entered into a weird, foreing terrain. Its full of tall trees, hiding you under them.

Whatever the answer is, you decide to head further in. There must be somebody, somewhere.
Deep Forest: You keep going and going, untill not even the smallest ray of sunshine comes through. 
Suddenly.
A treat.
...
You feel a crushing force around your throath.
You cant move.
Cant breath.

Prison: You wake up in a new environment. A prison.
Ouh.
There is somebody there.
[Abroach the figure?]
You decide to dismiss the figure in the corner.
"Hello?"
...
The figure seems to be asleep for now.
...
....
...
Its quiet.
...
..
..
A loud bang wakes you upt from your thoughts.
Guard stands outside the prison door, looking serious.
??? "About time you wake up. Queen has been running around for hour already."
You take a closer look.
Its a full grown husky soldier.
You must be dreaming.
??? "...."
Guard is not too pleased about the situation.
He rushes in and grabs your arm, dragging you behind him like nothing.
After a maze of corridors and hallways, you enter into a big fancy hall.
Your eyes zoom to a small figure rushing closer.
??? "Oi Yuki! The creature is awake! Quick, quick, bring him over."
Yuki:...Majesty Pepsi.
The guard let out a long sigh.
Yuki: Here it is.
Yuki:...
Yuki: What ever it is.
Yuki, the guard seems to leave you two alone for now.
