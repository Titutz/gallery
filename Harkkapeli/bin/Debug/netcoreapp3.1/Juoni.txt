Its full of tall trees, and creeping shadows.
You decide to head further in. There must be somebody, somewhere.

You are utterly lost. 
Suddenly.
You feel a crushing force around your throath.
You cant move.
Cant breath.

Ouh.

A loud bang wakes you up from your thoughts.
A guard stands outside the prison door, looking serious.
[NPC] YUKI
Yuki: "About time you wake up. Queen has been running around for hours already."
You take a closer look.
Its a full grown husky soldier.
You must be dreaming.
Yuki: "...."
Guard is not too pleased about the situation.
He opens the door and gestures you to step outside.
You leave in silence, leaving a suddle snoring figure behind you.
Prison Hall: You are alone with the guard, quietly huffing and growling something.
[Choice] Want to talk to him?
After a maze of corridors and hallways, you leave the underground dungeon.
Courtyard: The castle looks amazing.
What is all this?
Are you dreaming or something [nimi]?
Where are you excatly?
Yuki grunts at your expression.
Yuki: "CÂ´mon slowpoke. This way."

The halls are large and empty. 
Only your steps echos in here.
Yuki opens a large door at the end of the hallway.

But you notice something else.
A small figure rushing closer.
[NPC] PEPSI YUKI
Pepsi: "Oi Yuki! The creature is awake! Quick, quick, bring him over."

The guard let out a long sigh.
Yuki: Here it is.
